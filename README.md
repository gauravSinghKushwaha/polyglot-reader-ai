Polyglot reader is a scalable and modular backend application built with FastAPI and React, designed to support a language model (LLAMA) project. This application allows users to interact with books by selecting text to perform various operations such as translation, vocabulary assistance, summary generation, quiz creation, and querying based on the selected content. The backend is designed to be stateless and easily integrable with any frontend framework.
