He didn't like people who wore funny clothes - it made him uncomfortable. He thought maybe this was a new fashion trend that he didn't understand. As he looked around, he saw some older people talking excitedly with younger people. One of them was wearing an emerald-green cloak! Mr. Dursley got annoyed because the man was much older than him and wore such an unusual outfit. But then he thought maybe this was just a silly prank - these people were probably collecting money for something..."
