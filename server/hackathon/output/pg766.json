Nobody seemed to want it, so I don't know why it was put up for sale. The only person who bid on it was an attorney who offered two pounds cash and some wine as payment. He didn't want to guarantee that he wouldn't drown if the price went higher. So, the advertisement was taken down because nobody wanted to buy it. Ten years later, my mother's sherry was being sold in our town, so we put the caul up for sale again. We gave it away to fifty people for just five cents each. I remember feeling weird when a part of me was given away like that. The old lady who won the caul took out her winnings - five dollars made up of half-dollars and two-and-a-half cents. It took a long time to figure out how much she owed, but she never got wet. She died in bed at the age of ninety-two. I heard that until then, she was very proud of not having ever been on a boat or even near water, except for crossing a bridge. When she had tea, she would always say 'Let's stay on land.' It didn't matter what we said to her about how nice it is to travel and have new experiences."

However, there were signs that they didn't get along well. Some people thought he might have hit her, and even suspected him of trying to throw her out of a window once because they disagreed about something. These things made Miss Betsey decide to leave him and end their marriage. He went to India with his money, and some family stories say he was seen riding an elephant with a monkey.

My mom replied, 'Mr. Copperfield chose the name when he bought the house. He liked to think there were rooks around it.' The wind was blowing strongly in the garden, making the old elm trees sway.

Some old rooks' nests were hanging from their branches, looking like broken ships on a stormy sea. 'Where are the birds?' asked Miss Betsey. My mom was thinking of something else. 'What happened to the rooks?' asked Miss Betsey."

What's wrong with him?' Mr. Chillip told her to be calm and not worry anymore. He said it was all over now and everything is okay.

A woman named Peggotty likes to make sure no one is trying to break into or hurt our house. But if she sees me looking at something other than the minister, she gets upset with me. I try not to look at the minister because I know him without his special robe on, and I'm afraid he might think I'm staring at him weirdly. What can I do? It's hard to stop staring, but I have to do something. I look around and see my mom pretending not to notice me. I also see a boy making funny faces at me from the aisle. The sunlight coming through the open door makes me see a sheep outside. If I keep looking at it, I might say something silly out loud! I look up at the big tablets on the wall with pictures of people who used to live in this church. I wonder what their families felt when they were sad and sick for a long time. I think about Mr. Bodgers, who was very sick, and how his wife must have felt. I also think about Mr. Chillip, who came to help him, but maybe didn't make him feel better. When I look at the pulpit, I imagine it would be a great place to play with my friends. We could climb up the stairs and use the soft cushion on top of our heads. Eventually, my eyes get tired, and I fall asleep. But then I wake up and Peggotty takes me out of the pew because I fell off!"

The shape of his face reminded me of a wax figure that had come to our town a few months ago.

I have thought, since,\nthat its assuming that character was a necessary consequence of Mr.\nMurdstone’s firmness, which wouldn’t allow him to let anybody off from\nthe utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find any excuse\nfor. Be this as it may, I well remember the tremendous visages with\nwhich we used to go to church, and the changed air of the place. Again,\nthe dreaded Sunday comes round, and I file into the old pew first, like\na guarded captive brought to a condemned service. Again, Miss Murdstone,\nin a black velvet gown, that looks as if it had been made out of a pall,\nfollows close upon me; then my mother; then her husband. There is no\nPeggotty now, as in the old time. Again, I listen to Miss Murdstone\nmumbling the responses, and emphasizing all the dread words with a cruel\nrelish. Again, I see her dark eyes roll round the church when she says\n‘miserable sinners’, as if she were calling all the congregation names.\nAgain, I catch rare glimpses of my mother, moving her lips timidly\nbetween the two, with one of them muttering at each ear like low\nthunder. Again, I wonder with a sudden fear whether it is likely that\nour good old clergyman can be wrong, and Mr. and Miss Murdstone right,\nand that all the angels in Heaven can be destroying angels. Again, if I\nmove a finger or relax a muscle of my face, Miss Murdstone pokes me with\nher prayer-book, and makes my side ache.",

It cramped and hurt me so, that it made me perfectly\nmiserable; but if I moved in the least, and made a glass that was in the\nbasket rattle against something else (as it was sure to do), she gave\nme the cruellest poke with her foot, and said, ‘Come, don’t YOU fidget.\nYOUR bones are young enough, I’m sure!’",
