The prince said, 'I'm glad you're going to Egypt because you've been here too long. But I want you to kiss me on the lips because I love you.' The swallow said, 'I'm not going to Egypt.

'We need another statue,' he said, 'and it should be a statue of me.' 'Of me' said each of the town leaders, and they started arguing. When I last heard about them, they were still fighting. A worker at the factory said, 'This broken heart won't melt in the fire. We have to throw it away.' So they threw it on a pile of trash where a dead bird was also lying. God told one of His angels to bring Him two special things from the city. The angel brought Him the melted heart and the dead bird. God said, 'You chose right,' because in his beautiful garden, the little bird will sing forever, and in his shiny city, the Happy Prince will praise me."
